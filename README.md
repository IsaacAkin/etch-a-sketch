# Key Features

## Sketchpad

- When the mouse is hovered over the sketchpad, colour will begin to fill it. You can change the mode by selecting one of the buttons, use the eraser to clear any previous lines created, or clear the sketchpad entirely and start from scratch. You can also change the size of the sketchpad by increasing or decreasing the slider that is located underneath the buttons.

## Black Colour

- The `Black` button when pressed sets the colour to black. When the mouse hovers over the sketchpad, a black trail will follow it.

## Rainbow Colour

- The `Rainbow` button when pressed sets the colour to a random RBG value. When the mouse hovers over the sketchpad, a RGB value will be chosen at random and a trail will follow the mouse.

## Eraser

- The `Eraser` button when pressed sets the colour to white. When the mouse hovers over the sketchpad, a white trail will follow the mouse, effectively erasing any colour that was previously in the area.

## Clear

- The `Clear` button when pressed sets the colour of the whole sketchpad to white, effectively erasing any lines that were previously drawn.

## Range Slider

- The `Range Slider` shows the current size of the sketchpad (e.g. 16 x 16) and can be used to change its size. The slider can be set to as low as 1 and as high as 100. When the slider is moved, a new grid is made in place of the previous one.
